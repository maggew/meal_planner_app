# Meal Planner App

Mobile application for managing and searching recipes.

## Motivation

This project serves as a practical learning project to deepen my knowledge
in Flutter and mobile app architecture and to prepare for a role as a
software developer.

## Features (Current State)

- Create and manage recipes
- Search and filter recipes
- User authentication

## Tech Stack

- Flutter (Dart)
- State Management: Riverpod
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Authentication & Storage: Firebase

## Project Scope

The focus of this repository is on application architecture, state management,
and backend integration. Feature completeness is not the primary goal.

## Setup

This project requires external configuration files and environment variables
which are not included in the repository for security reasons.

- Supabase credentials via `.env`
- Firebase configuration files (`google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist`)

## Status

Work in Progress – with a focus on clean architecture, clear separation of
business logic and UI, and practical implementation.
